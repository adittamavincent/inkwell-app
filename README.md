# Inkwell – System‑wide Keystroke Logger for Obsidian 🖋️

> **A lightweight macOS desktop utility that captures your keystrokes system‑wide and writes them into an Obsidian note.**
>
> Inkwell is built with **Electron + React + Tailwind CSS** with TypeScript.
> It records keystrokes across all macOS apps (Chrome, Terminal, Slack, WhatsApp, etc.) and, when you opt in, appends them to a daily *keylog* note managed by the [Cogdex Vault Companion](https://github.com/adittamavincent/cogdex-vault-companion) Obsidian plugin.

## How it works

1. Global keystrokes are captured system-wide via `uiohook-napi` in the Electron main process (requires **Accessibility** and **Input Monitoring** permissions in macOS System Settings).
2. Permission states are queried directly via native OS APIs (`node-mac-permissions` wrapping `AXIsProcessTrustedWithOptions` and `IOHIDCheckAccess`).
3. Each keystroke is encrypted at rest with **AES-256-GCM** before being inserted into SQLite (`better-sqlite3` in WAL mode) located in `~/Library/Application Support/com.inkwell.app/inkwell.db`.
   The encryption key lives in a `0600` file (`db.key`) next to the database.
4. When Cogdex sync is **enabled (opt-in, off by default)**, captured sessions are reconstructed into readable text and appended directly to today's dedicated daily keylog note (`<dailyFolderRoot>/<day>/<day><keylogSuffix>.md`).
5. Live UI typing feed reconstructs text in real-time with cursor tracking, arrow navigation, word deletions, and selection overwriting.

The keylog note path mirrors Cogdex:

```text
<Vault>/Daily/YYYY-MM-DD/YYYY-MM-DD - keylog.md
```

i.e. `<dailyFolderRoot>/<day>/<day><keylogSuffix>.md`.

## Features

- **System‑wide keystroke capture** – works across all macOS apps.
- **Native OS permission detection** – deterministic, read-only 3-state permission checks (`authorized`, `denied`, `not determined`) without heuristic polling latency or auto-prompt loops.
- **Frontmost‑app detection** – every keystroke is tagged with the active app name (cached for 250ms for zero capture latency).
- **App exclusion** – password managers (1Password, Bitwarden, KeePass, etc.) and Inkwell itself are excluded by default.
- **Encrypted at rest** – AES-256-GCM encrypted database with graceful plaintext degradation fallback.
- **Smart token reconstruction** – backspaces `[⌫]`, forward delete `[⌦]`, word deletions `[⌥⌫]`, line clears `[⌘⌫]`, selection overwriting `[⇧←] [⇧→]`, and select-all `[⌘A]` faithfully reconstruct what you typed.
- **Session grouping** – sessions split automatically on active app switch or idle timeout (default 60s).
- **Collapsible settings drawer** – smooth slide-out panel for Cogdex sync settings.
- **macOS System Tray** – menu bar icon showing real-time capture status with pause/resume controls.

## Development & Testing

```bash
pnpm install              # install dependencies
pnpm run dev              # launch Electron + React dev server with HMR
pnpm run test             # run all Vitest unit tests
pnpm run typecheck        # TypeScript typecheck
pnpm run build:renderer   # build renderer & electron main/preload bundles
pnpm run build            # build and package for macOS (.dmg + .zip)
```

## Testing Permissions: Dev vs Packaged App

`pnpm dev` launches via `vite-plugin-electron` through the default `electron` binary from `node_modules/electron`. macOS TCC identifies this process as **`com.github.Electron` (named "Electron")**, completely separate from the signed, packaged **`com.inkwell.app` (named "Inkwell")**.

- **Dev mode (`pnpm dev`)**: To test or grant permissions in dev mode, grant access to the **"Electron"** entry in macOS System Settings.
- **Packaged App (`pnpm build`)**: To validate the exact permission flow an end user sees, test against `pnpm build` output installed into `/Applications`. Permissions granted here belong to **"Inkwell"**.

### Resetting Permissions (Clean Slate)

Reset dev mode permissions:
```bash
pnpm run reset-permissions:dev
# or manually:
tccutil reset Accessibility com.github.Electron
tccutil reset ListenEvent com.github.Electron
```

Reset packaged app permissions:
```bash
pnpm run reset-permissions
# or manually:
tccutil reset Accessibility com.inkwell.app
tccutil reset ListenEvent com.inkwell.app
```

## Packaging & Releases

Inkwell runs as a menu-bar-only background app (no Dock icon, `LSUIElement`). Only the Tray's Quit Inkwell item fully terminates the process; Cmd+Q and the window close button just hide the window.

Bundling is handled by `electron-builder` targeting macOS Apple Silicon (`arm64`):

```bash
pnpm run build
# or to output unpacked .app directory only:
pnpm run pack
```

### Local Dev Signing Setup

To prevent macOS from revoking Accessibility and Input Monitoring permissions on every local rebuild, Inkwell is signed with a stable local code-signing certificate named `Inkwell Dev`.

#### One-Time Setup:
1. Open **Keychain Access** on macOS.
2. In the menu bar, navigate to **Keychain Access → Certificate Assistant → Create a Certificate...**
3. Configure the certificate:
   - **Name**: `Inkwell Dev`
   - **Identity Type**: `Self Signed Root`
   - **Certificate Type**: `Code Signing`
4. Click **Create**, then **Continue**.

Permissions granted in macOS System Settings will now persist across `pnpm run build` and reinstall cycles.

> **Note on Hardened Runtime**: Local self-signed certificates do not have an Apple Team ID chain, so `hardenedRuntime: false` is configured in `electron-builder.yml` for local builds. Production release builds paired with an official Apple Developer ID certificate and notarization will re-enable `hardenedRuntime: true`.

### Running the unsigned build

GitHub Releases builds are distributed as an **unsigned, ad-hoc** `.dmg`/`.zip` and are **not notarized** because the project does not have a paid Apple Developer Program membership. macOS Gatekeeper will therefore quarantine the downloaded app and may show a message like *"Inkwell.app can't be opened because it is from an unidentified developer"* on first launch.

To open the app anyway:

1. **Recommended:** In Finder, **right-click (or Control-click)** the `Inkwell.app` (or the app inside the mounted `.dmg`) and choose **Open**. In the security dialog that appears, click **Open** again to allow it.

2. If the right-click method still fails, open Terminal and remove the quarantine attribute:

   ```bash
   xattr -cr /Applications/Inkwell.app
   ```

   Then launch the app normally.

### Troubleshooting: `hdiutil resize` failures

During `pnpm run build` (or `electron-builder` packaging), you may occasionally encounter an error like:
```text
⨯ unable to execute hdiutil args=["resize","-size","...",...]
hdiutil: resize: failed. Resource temporarily unavailable (35)
```

#### Cause
This error (`Exit code: 35` / `EAGAIN`) is an OS-level resource contention issue on macOS. It happens when a previous build failed or was interrupted, leaving a stale mounted disk image or a lock held by `hdiutil` / `diskarbitrationd` in the temp directory (`/private/var/folders/.../T/`).

#### Automatic Cleanup
This repository includes an automatic pre-dist cleanup script (`scripts/predist-cleanup.sh`) hooked to `predist` in `package.json`. It runs automatically before `pnpm run build` to detect and force-detach stale mounted DMG volumes and remove residual temporary build directories.

#### Manual Resolution (If cleanup is not enough)
If `pnpm run build` still fails with error 35:

1. **Check mounted disk images**:
   ```bash
   hdiutil info | grep -A5 "image-path"
   ```
2. **Force-detach any stale volumes**:
   ```bash
   hdiutil detach /dev/diskX -force
   ```
3. **Check available disk space**:
   Ensure your boot volume (`/`) and temporary directory location have sufficient free disk space. Low disk space or inode pressure can cause sparse image resizing to fail.
4. **Reboot**:
   If `diskarbitrationd` or `hdiutil` remains locked, rebooting your Mac will clear all disk arbitration locks and temporary volume mounts.

> **Note:** `dmg.format: 'ULFO'` is configured in `electron-builder.config.cjs` to use LZFSE compression for better stability on Apple Silicon toolchains, but it cannot override an active OS-level file lock.
